# DevTale
Essentially... it's just a basic old-school packet logger for NosTale (a really old and broken mmorpg game), with ambitions to become something more. Although it may resemble old Elektrochemie's work, it's been written by me from scratch. *Ok, fine, I recycled some code from my old projects, so let's say almost from scratch.*
